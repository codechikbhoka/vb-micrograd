# Neural Network Implementation

A Python implementation of a neural network from scratch, demonstrating the fundamentals of deep learning with a focus on backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Overview

This project implements a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. It includes implementations of forward propagation, backward propagation, and various activation functions. The network is designed to be flexible and can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Key Components

### Neural Network Class

The main neural network implementation includes:
- Flexible layer architecture
- Forward propagation
- Backward propagation
- Weight initialization
- Training methods

### Activation Functions

Supported activation functions:

- Gradient checking
- Performance metrics

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the neural network:

```python
from src.neural_network import NeuralNetwork
import numpy as np

# Create a neural network with 3 layers
nn = NeuralNetwork([
    {"input_dim": 2, "output_dim": 4, "activation": "relu"},
    {"input_dim": 4, "output_dim": 3, "activation": "relu"},
    {"input_dim": 3, "output_dim": 1, "activation": "sigmoid"}
])

# Train the network
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])  # Input data
y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])              # Target values

nn.train(X, y, epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.1)

# Make predictions
predictions = nn.predict(X)
```

## Required Packages

- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
